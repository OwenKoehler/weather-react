# A Weather App Built With React

## Beforehand

This app requires a free API key from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api). Obtain a key and paste it into a .env file that you create. An example [.env](./.env.example) file has been provided.

## Save Favorite Zipcodes Feature

Saving favorite zipcodes requires running the app alongside the [Zipcode API App](https://github.com/OwenKoehler/zipcode-api).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
